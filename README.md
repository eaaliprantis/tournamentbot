# tournamentbot
A bot that uses Discord, Challonge, and Google Sheets to automate running tournaments

Derived from Music Bot https://github.com/SexualRhinoceros/MusicBot, which this bot is not for profit.

Original modifications and additions done by Emanuel Aliprantis, with the assistance from Robert Klebes, whom blackmailed Emanuel Aliprantis for money.  If you would like the pastebins, please request one in the issues.

NOTE: Does not currently use a Discord Bot account, though the required changes should be trivial.
